# Important info

 - For usage of map aerials, you must **have a tool in "online"** mode:

 - You have to choose one from the list of map types:

 If you want to change the map type in runtime, there is no problem. You can change it whenever you want and it immediately changes downloaded images to the corresponding type. **For the changes to take effect in the editor, you must redownload tile aerials.**

# OMSI and OMSI2
In ***options.cfg*** (located in game directory), find this parameter:

    [Editor_LinkAerial]

Under this, **paste your URL address**, that you copied from this tool. For example:

    [Editor_LinkAerial]
    http://127.0.0.1:5050/getAerials/~z/~x/~y/
    
In most cases, **URL stays the same** every launch of the tool, so you have to edit ***options.cfg*** only after the first run.

After this, you should be able to download and use the Mapy.cz  aerials:
